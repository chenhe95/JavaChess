Please note that I do not claim credit for any of the files in the "net" directory of the "src"
Those files are from an image library (http://image4j.sourceforge.net/) I found to process the ".ico" files used in this game. 

Likewise, the .ico files of the chess pieces I use in the "images" directory are not of my own making. The chess piece .ico files are from http://www.virtualpieces.net/ 
Also, the carbon background used is from http://www.wallpaperhi.com/ and I did not make it.
